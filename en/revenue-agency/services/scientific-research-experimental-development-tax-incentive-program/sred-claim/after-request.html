<p>A Research and Technology Advisor (RTA) will review your information, meet with you to discuss your application, and provide you with a decision.</p>
  <ol class="lst-stps stps-strpd ld-zr">
      <li>
    <h3>Get assigned an RTA</h3>
      <!--  <p><span class="far fa-clock mrgn-rght-sm fa-md"></span><strong>Timeframe:</strong> Within <strong>2 weeks</strong></p>-->
<p>After you have submitted your application for pre-claim approval, an RTA will contact the person indicated in box 034 of the application form.</p> 
 <p>The RTA will phone to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm your official language of choice </li>
  <li>Explain the pre-claim approval process </li>
    <li>Explain the SR&amp;ED program requirements and how a project can receive pre-claim approval </li>
    <li>Answer your questions about SR&amp;ED pre-claim approval requirements </li>
<li>Discuss any aspects of your proposed project that may require more information or clarification</li>
  <li>Set-up a meeting that will take virtually or on site, when your staff with in-depth knowledge of the proposed SR&amp;ED work are available</li>
</ul>
  <p class="mrgn-tp-md">After the phone call, you will receive an email in your CRA account that will summarize what was discussed during the call and will provide both: 
  <ul>
    <li>An agenda for the upcoming meeting with an estimated time commitment (between 2 to 5 hours) </li>
    <li>The contact information for the RTA and their manager</li>
  </ul>
      </li>
    <li>
  <h3>Prepare to meet with your RTA</h3>
  
<p>We recommend you: </p> 

  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the availability of the individuals you choose to participate in the meeting, including the technical expert from the business</li>
    <li>Be prepared to discuss:
      <ul>
        <li>The existing state of knowledge or technology as pertains to your proposed project</li>
      <li>The scientific or technological uncertainty the project is aiming to address</li>   
 <li>The work to be carried out during the requested pre-claim approval period to overcome the scientific or the technological uncertainty</li>
    <li>How you plan to structure your systematic investigation or search, including initial hypothesis and planned experiments or analyses</li>
  </ul></li>
    <li>Confirm you have received the invitation for the virtual meeting (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>
</li><li>
  <h3>Meet with your RTA</h3>
      <!-- <p><span class="far fa-clock mrgn-rght-sm fa-md"></span><strong>Timeframe:</strong> Within <strong>4 weeks</strong></p>-->
	
 <p>The meeting will be a discussion between the RTA and the business, to provide the RTA with any details required to determine whether the work in the planned project meets the definition of SR&amp;ED.</p>
<p>To better understand your business, the RTA may request a tour of your place of business or manufacturing premises during the meeting. This can be done either virtually or on-site. A tour provides an opportunity for the RTA to visualize and contextualize your business environment.  </p>
   <p>If the tour is being conducted virtually, you can present your work in a virtual manner by: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Presenting slides or other documents through screen sharing during a videoconference </li>
    <li>Using a camera-equipped laptop or mobile device to take the meeting participants on a tour of the facility</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mrgn-tp-md">At the end of the meeting, your RTA will provide a verbal summary of: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Their understanding of the scientific or technological uncertainty and your planned approach to address it</li>
    <li>The additional information or clarifications they obtained during the meeting</li>
    <li>Any areas where they still have concerns and require further clarification (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Recommendations for future applications or SR&amp;ED claims</li>
  </ul>
  </li></ol>

  <h2>Find out if you are approved</h2>
    <!--  <p><span class="far fa-clock mrgn-rght-sm fa-md"></span><strong>Timeframe:</strong> Within <strong>8 weeks</strong></p>-->
	
  <p>Your RTA will communicate their decision to you by phone or videoconference before sending it to you in writing.</p>
  <p>The pre-claim approval report will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide confirmation on whether the project is granted pre-approval</li>
    <li>Include details and a rationale on the decision, and may provide you with recommendations to help you with future applications or SR&amp;ED claims</li>
  </ul>  


  <h3 id="h2">If changes are made to the proposed project </h3> 
  <p>If your project is granted pre-claim approval, and over the course of the pre-claim approval period you make material changes to your project, we encourage you to reach out to the RTA or <a href="">contact us</a>. </p>
 

	
<h2 id="h3">Disagreeing with CRA's decision </h2> 
<p>There is no appeal process for pre-claim approval.</p>  
<p>If your pre-claim approval is denied and you do not agree with the decision, you can talk with the RTA or their manager to try to resolve any disputes.</p>
<p>If you are not able to resolve the dispute(s), you may make material changes to the proposed project and either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Re-submit an application for pre-claim approval with the changes to the proposed project</li>
  <li>Move forward without pre-claim approval and submit an SR&amp;ED claim for the project after undertaking the work </li>
</ul>
  
   

  <h2 id="h4">Get support after you apply</h2>
  <p><a href="">Contact us</a> if you have any questions about the SR&amp;ED program or your application for pre-claim approval. </p>
